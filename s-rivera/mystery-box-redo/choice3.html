            Based on the "King of Beasts'" spirit of persistence from 
            <i>The Lion King</i>. Located in a desert area near a Spelldrive 
            stadium, this dorm houses athletic, tenacious, and competitive
            students, many of whom are beastmen. It emphasizes strength 
            and determination to overcome any obstacle.
