            Based on the "Thorn Fairy" from <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, embodying 
            the spirit of nobility. It is characterized by its gothic, 
            castle-like atmosphere, scarce sunlight, and a student body 
            known for exceptional magical capabilities. It prioritizes, 
            and was founded for, naturally gifted students.
