            Based on the "Sorcerer of the Sands" from <i>Aladdin</i> 
            designed around the spirit of mindfulness, careful planning, 
            and resourcefulness. It features a warm, opulent, 
            Middle Eastern-inspired aesthetic, including desert 
            landscapes, an oasis, and luxurious, richly decorated interiors.
