            Based on the strict, orderly spirit of the "Queen of Heart's" from 
            <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. Known for enforcing 810 bizarre 
            rules. Students are defined by their strict adherence 
            to a rigid, often absurd, code of conduct. They are also known 
            for being the largest, most disciplined dorm, who are often 
            seen wearing red-and-white uniforms, and value justice.
