            <p>
                Gachiakuta takes place in a dystopian world where
                there exists a floating country-sized structure known as
                the Sphere (天界, Tenkai), which runs on a social caste
                system that divides the rich and wealthy society from
                the poor "tribesfolk" living around the outer
                perimeter—descended from notorious criminals and
                exiled by the upper-class—by way of a heavily-guarded
                wall. Both sides of the caste dump their trash and 
                nwanted waste, as well as people convicted of any crime,
                down the "Pit", a never-ending expanses below the Sphere
                in which the Spherites (天界人, Tenkai Jin)—the inhabitants
                of the Sphere—deemed inhospitable to all forms of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unbeknown to the Spherites, beyond the Pit and the
                "Border" (ボーダー, Bōdā) separating it from the Sphere
                lies the "Ground" (下界, Gekai), a lawless wasteland with
                a mostly toxic environment infested with the Spherites'
                waste due to the constant downpour of trash from the Sphere,
                its heavily polluted areas are often roamed about by
                Trash Beasts (斑獣, Han-jū), living creatures literally made
                of trash. Amongst its various inhabitants and wandering
                troublemakers—mostly survived being thrown down the Pit
                by the Spherites and has since made a thriving civilized
                network of towns—there exists the Cleaners (掃除屋, Sōjiya),
                a group of super-powered individuals known as
                "Givers" (人通者ギバー, Gibā) specialized with handling
                odd-jobs and exterminating Trash Beasts as conventional
                weaponry doesn't work on them due to its regenerative
                properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each Giver has access to their respective Vital Instrument
                (人器, Jinki), powerful weapons converted from everyday
                objects by infusing them with the Giver's own capacity
                to generate Anima (思念, Shinen) from their body. Often
                the only thing capable of taking down Trash Beasts, Vital
                Instruments are usually the manifestation of a Giver's
                love and care for these treasured objects, allowing their
                Anima to awakened and make these worthless items valuable
                in combat. Additionally, the longer a Giver tends to their
                valued object with love and care, the more seasoned and
                better it becomes as a Vital Instrument, thus “improving
                its quality” and making it more powerful, as it also serves
                as a conduit for a Giver's own experience and ideology as
                a person. Amongst the many Vital Instruments used by the
                various Givers of the Ground, there also exist the Watchman
                Series (番人シリーズ, Bannin Shirīzu), a set of five
                unfathomably powerful Vital Instruments said to be
                connected to the Watchman (番人, Bannin)—a gigantic,
                incomprehensible being guarding the border between the
                Sphere and the Ground—and that usually require the wielder
                to have lost something in their life to use them without
                going insane from their power.

            <p>
                A young teenage boy named Rudo lives in the slums of
                a wealthy society among the "tribesfolk", a populati
                descended from criminals and exiled by society. Rudo
                detests the upper class's wastefulness, as they o
                dump anything deemed trash, including criminals, into a
                massive dump site below the town known as "The Pit". Rudo
                was told by his foster father Regto that his biological
                father was dumped into the Pit for a crime before Rudo
                was born. One day, after rummaging through a dump site,
                Rudo returns home to find Regto murdered. Apprehended at the
                scene, Rudo is immediately charged with murder despite being
                innocent, due to his status as a tribesman. Unable to
                escape his fate, Rudo swears revenge upon the people and
                is dumped into the Pit.
            </p>
            <p>
                After being dumped into the Pit, Rudo awakens to find
                himself disoriented in a foul-smelling, endless landscape
                of trash. Rudo is then attacked by large beasts made of
                trash and fends them off until he is rescued by a man
                named Enjin. The man explains that he is not underground
                but has fallen to the surface from "The Sphere". After
                testing him and awakening his power as a "Giver", Enjin
                invites Rudo to join him as a "Cleaner". Enjin explains
                that the Cleaners are an organization of Givers who use
                the power of unique weapons known as "vital instruments"
                (人器, jinki) to hunt the trash beasts that attacked him.
                Rudo reluctantly accepts Enjin's offer to join the Cleaners,
                so long as it helps accomplish his goal of returning to the
                Sphere and enacting revenge on those who dumped him into
                the Pit.

                A former Sphereite, as well as Regto's adopted son,
                whose false convictions led to his sentencing to The Pit.
                After being saved from a group of trash beasts, he joins
                the Cleaners as part of his plan to enact murderous vengeance
                on his accusers and the true culprit. His vital instrument
                consists of 3R, a pair of gloves from the Watchman series,
                which were given to him by Regto before his death. Rudo's
                gloves allow him to give life to any three objects he wields,
                which are mainly trash since items that are still in good
                condition are harder for him to use. He would turn them
                into weapons or tools, though they would crumble after
                they had served their purpose. Rudo can focus the anima
                energy from three separate items into one item, boosting
                that specific item's power and even changing its form.
