        <h1>You chose to stand your ground</h1>
        <p>
            To your surprise, a bright light started to emanate from somewhere,
            your chest, you realize.
        </p>
        <p>
            The monster didn't seem to like the sudden light in the dimly lit
            mine as it moved back from you. With a sudden boost of confidence,
            you began to move towards the monster, causing it to shriek.
        </p>

        >
        <p>
            You notice the skin on the monster began to bubble from where
            your light was hitting it. Before long, the tar-like skin has
            evaporated, along with it, the monster.
