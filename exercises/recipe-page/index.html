        <h1>French-Style Hot Chocolate</h1>
        
        <p>
            This is the kind of hot chocolate you sip slowly. 
            Thick, creamy, and made with real chocolate, it tastes like 
            something you’d order at a French café — but made at home and 
            even better. Simple ingredients, rich texture, and really good 
            chocolate flavor.

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h3>MAKE THE HOT CHOCOLATE:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan over medium heat, add the milk, heavy cream, 
                and brown sugar. Heat gently, stirring occasionally, until 
                steaming but not boiling.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Add the chopped chocolate and pinch of salt. Whisk 
                continuously until the chocolate is fully melted and the 
                mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Pour into mugs and top with whipped cream before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>WHIPPED CREAM:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract to 
                a large bowl or stand mixer fitted with 
                the whisk attachment.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Whip on medium speed until the mixture thickens and soft, 
                billowy peaks form.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Stop mixing as soon as the whipped cream looks smooth 
                and fluffy—overmixing will make it grainy and less smooth.
            </li>
        </ol>
